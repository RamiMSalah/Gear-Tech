Egypt mainly depends on non-renewable energy sources such as oil, fossil fuels,
and natural gas. These sources affected the environment in many negative ways.
Increasing the greenhouse gases emissions and harming all living species. In
addition, these sources are not long-lasting sources that we can depend on all of
our life, and this lack causes dangerous problems. For example, Egypt has suffered
from electricity block-outs for the last few years. Or waiting for hours in the gas
station just to refill your carâ€™s tank with this toxic liquid. Moreover, several
diseases occur after rising pollutants and wastes are produced by non-renewable
energy.
The selection of solution
Last year Egypt faced a massive crisis
with energy production and lack of
alternative energy as it depends mainly on
non-renewable sources of energy. Non-
renewable resources make up 85% of
worldwide power. These sources
negatively affect the environment by the green
emissions that cause air, water pollution, acid rain, and
climate change. Egypt is looking forward to increased use of
alternative energy like mechanical power, wind, solar energy,
energy as it is reliable, affordable, and environment friendly.
